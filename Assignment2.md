● - What is `NPM`?
    NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to discover, share, and reuse code packages and manage project dependencies.

● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
     Parcel and Webpack are both module bundlers for JavaScript applications. They allow developers to bundle various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, into a single package for deployment. This process helps optimize the performance of web applications by reducing the number of HTTP requests and enabling features like code splitting and asset optimization.

● - What is `.parcel-cache`
    .parcel-cache is a directory created by Parcel to store cached data for faster subsequent builds. It helps improve build performance by reusing previously processed assets.

● - What is `npx` ?
   npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2.0 and higher. It allows you to execute packages from the npm registry without having to install them globally. It's commonly used for running commands provided by packages, such as build tools or utilities.

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
  dependencies are packages required for the application to run, while devDependencies are packages required for development and testing purposes. Dependencies listed in dependencies will be installed when someone installs your package, while devDependencies will only be installed if someone is developing or testing the package.

● - What is Tree Shaking?
    Tree shaking is a process used by bundlers to eliminate dead code (unused imports) from the final bundle. It helps reduce the size of the bundle by removing unused modules, resulting in smaller file sizes and improved performance.

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
   Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in module bundlers like Webpack and Parcel that allows modules to be replaced or updated in real time without requiring a full page reload. It enables developers to see the changes they make to their code instantly reflected in the browser, making the development process faster and more efficient.

● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
    Zero Configuration: Parcel requires little to no configuration out of the box, making it easy to set up and use.
    Automatic Asset Transformation: Parcel automatically transforms assets like JavaScript, CSS, and images, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
    Built-in Hot Module Replacement: Parcel has built-in support for Hot Module Replacement, allowing developers to see changes instantly without having to reload the page.

           You can more features below
              *HMR: Hot module reloading-parcel will keep a track of all the files that you are updating
              * FileWatcher Algorithm-its implemented using c++
              * parcel-cache:when parcel was doing HMR, filewatcher,minification of out files, all these things then it will need some space to store them
              * dis folder: it keeps the file minified for us
              * when we do npx parcel index.html it creates development build for us and its host it on the server
              * we ca tell parcel to make a production build by using build command

● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
    // anything which is auto generated should be put inside the git ignore

● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
    package.json is a manifest file that contains metadata about the project and lists the project dependencies. package-lock.json is automatically generated by npm to lock down the version of dependencies installed in node_modules, ensuring consistent builds across different environments.

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
    Modifying package-lock.json manually is not recommended because it's automatically generated and managed by npm. Directly editing it could lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior in your project's dependencies.

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
    node_modules is a directory where npm installs project dependencies. It's not a good idea to push node_modules to Git because it contains a large number of files, and dependencies should be installed locally on each developer's machine using npm install.

● - What is the `dist` folder?
   The dist (distribution) folder is a directory where bundled and optimized files are outputted after the build process. It typically contains the final version of the project that is ready for deployment

● - What is `browserlists`
    browserslist is a configuration file used by tools like Autoprefixer and Babel to determine which browsers to support based on specified criteria, such as browser versions or usage statistics.

● Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda
    ^ (caret) in version ranges specifies that npm can install updates for the specified dependency as long as it's not a major version change (compatible with SemVer).
    ~ (tilde) in version ranges specifies that npm can install updates for the specified dependency as long as it's not a major or minor version change (compatible with SemVer).

● Read about Script types in html (MDN Docs)
  Script types in HTML are attributes used to define the type of script being referenced. Common types include text/javascript, module (for ES modules), and application/javascript. These attributes help browsers determine how to interpret and execute the script content.
